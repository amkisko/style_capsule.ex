# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We operate on principles of mutual respect, privacy, and authentic engagement. We value substantive contributions and clarity on intentions.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all members of the style_capsule community, including contributors, maintainers, and users, across all community venues:

* GitHub repositories and discussions
* Issue trackers and pull requests
* Community forums and mailing lists
* In-person events related to the project
* One-on-one communications pertaining to project affairs

When publishing to Hex.pm, we also adhere to [Hex's Code of Conduct](https://hex.pm/policies/codeofconduct).

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* **Authenticity:** Engaging with genuine curiosity and admitting uncertainty rather than feigning knowledge.

* **Responsible Innovation:** Taking full responsibility for any content or code contributed, whether manually written or generated by automation tools.

* **Gentle Correction:** Responding politely to errors. We view mistakes as opportunities for learning, provided they are addressed with humility.

* **Inclusive Language:** Using language that welcomes diverse perspectives and respects the privacy and identity of all participants.

* **Respectful Disagreement:** Acknowledging that differences in opinion regarding technical choices are natural. Every design or implementation choice carries trade-offs, and there is seldom a single right answer.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* **Harassment:** Public or private harassment, trolling, insulting comments, or any form of discriminatory behavior.

* **Weaponized Complexity:** Using jargon or overwhelming volume (including automated spam) to silence others.

* **Publishing Private Information:** Sharing others' data or personal context without explicit permission.

* **Abusive Behavior:** Threatening, abusive, or inciting violence against any groups or individuals.

* **Spam and Attention-Seeking:** Spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.

## Artificial Intelligence & Automation

In accordance with our commitment to **Collective Awareness**:

* Contributors are responsible for the accuracy and security of any AI-generated artifacts they submit.

* "The AI wrote it" is not a valid excuse for introducing bugs, security vulnerabilities, or bias.

* You must review, debug, and understand every line of code you submit, regardless of how it was generated.

## Reporting Violations

If you believe someone is harassing you or has otherwise violated this Code of Conduct, please contact the project team at **contact@kiskolabs.com**. 

When reporting, please include:
* As much detail as possible about the incident
* Any relevant context or evidence
* Your preferred method of follow-up

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. We are committed to maintaining confidentiality to the extent possible while conducting a thorough investigation.

## Consequences

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including:

* A warning
* A temporary ban from community spaces
* A permanent ban from the project

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the project team at **contact@kiskolabs.com**. We will do our best to ensure that your grievance is handled appropriately.

In general, we will choose the course of action that we judge as being most in the interest of fostering a safe and friendly community.

## Contact
